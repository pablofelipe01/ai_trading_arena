MACD has turned positive (20.490) after being deeply negative (-147.992), signaling a bullish crossover. Price is currently above the 20-period EMA (108012.4 > 107889.147), confirming upward trend. The 1-minute chart shows price stabilization around 108000 after a decline from 108300, suggesting support formation. The 3-minute and 15-minute timeframes show recent consolidation around current levels. Given this is the first trade with $100 available, entering a position with moderate size is appropriate. The recovery from the sharp drop to 107389 shows strong buying pressure. However, maintaining some caution due to recent volatility and the fact that price is still below recent highs around 108350."
